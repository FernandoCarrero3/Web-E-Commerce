âœ¨ Core Features
Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout for all devices, built mobile-first using Tailwind CSS.

Product Catalog: A clean grid layout for browsing products (Home page).

Product Details Page: A dedicated, dynamic route for each product (/product/:id).

Direct "Add to Cart": Users can add items to the cart directly from the home page for a fast user experience.

Advanced Shopping Cart:

Add items, increment quantity, decrement quantity, or remove items completely.

The cart automatically updates the total price.

State Management with Context API: All cart logic is managed globally using React's Context API.

Persistent Cart: The cart's state is saved to localStorage, so items are not lost when the user reloads the page.

Multi-Page Routing: Seamless navigation between the Home, Product, and Cart pages using react-router-dom.

(Planned) Full Checkout Flow:

A dedicated /checkout page with a form for user details.

An /order-success confirmation page to finalize the user's journey.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to serve as a high-quality portfolio item for potential clients (e.g., on platforms like Fiverr). It demonstrates the ability to build a robust, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing e-commerce application from the ground up, using industry-standard tools and best practices.

ðŸ’¡ Possible Future Improvements
This project serves as a strong foundation. Future enhancements could include:

Back-End Integration: Connect the front-end to a real database (like Firebase or a custom Node.js/Express API) to manage products and orders.

User Authentication: Add user sign-up and login (e.g., with Firebase Authentication or JWT).

Payment Gateway: Integrate a real payment processor like Stripe.

Advanced Filtering: Add filtering and sorting to the product list page.
